Full-stack engineer at mimacom, I'm moving towards frontend and UX. Always keen to learn and teach whatever I have to offer to others.

My passion is the creation of apps that improve people's lives. To do this, I try to grow not only in the technical aspect, but also in the user research and usability fields.

Making good apps is not only making them efficient and performant, they must also respond to a user's need and do so by providing a good experience.
