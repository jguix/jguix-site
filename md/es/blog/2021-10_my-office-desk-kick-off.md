# My Office Desk kick off

Today I'm starting a new project. I will call it for now "My Office Desk" but I might have second thoughts about that once I do some UX research.

The aim of the project is putting into practice what I learned in some Udemy tutorials that I recently followed, or I'm about to finish, about NextJS, and Flutter. I'm also trying to come out with a solution for rapid prototyping apps, creating MVPs that are simple but still scalable. And finally I think I can help others in the process. Perhaps people that are already competent in JavaScript can follow my steps to create a different app, or even help me when I get stuck on something.

I'll blog about the process to help me reflect on those things I learned. I believe that practice is completely necessary to actually learn stuff. Thus, I'm not usually happy with watching the videos, but I also follow the steps myself. That's practice level 101, let's say. The next level comes when you try something new applying what you learned. And if you are able to summarize, sinthesize, write about the topic or teach other people, then you get to learn the stuff deeper.

Someone might have instantly kringe when I said that my technical stack for this project will be NextJS + Flutter. If you are going to use React, why not using React Native for mobile, or why not creating a PWA? Or the other way around, why not creating everything in Flutter + Flutter web?

Truth is, I have had enough of pain with React Native, and I want to try something new. Hopefully, Flutter provides better developer experience -for the time I have been trying it, it does- and gives me enough to create a simple project. I don't want to use PWA because I want my app to live in the stores. And I don't trust much Flutter web for now. I don't think it's being used in production sites, and I wouldn't recommend my clients to use it, so for now I will leave it out of the equation.

That's the why, but the what is still missing. I'm gping to create a website and a mobile app for some office-related activities. Basically the app will handle reservation of desks in offices where the desks may be either flexible or rigidly assigned to people, and where they may be a quote of people coming to the office each day.

I think this is a situation that is getting more and more common after COVID. Companies move to smaller offices, or don't expand their offices even if they grow. Some desks are assigned by reservation, and all the people are not allowed to come the same day, because there's simply not space for all. Medical restrictions change frequently so we are used to have quotes in the number of people that can come to the office on the same day.

The app might grow with some other features -like time tracking or reservation of seats in the kitchen for lunch or other stuff- but to start I want to keep it simple.

In the next post I will create the NextJS app with typescript support. Stay tuned and see this app grow.
